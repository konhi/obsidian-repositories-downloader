## Motivation

This project was created in 2021. At the time, I wanted to write an Obsidian plugin, but there were no docs or tutorials. There was also no API documentation. The easiest approach was to learn from existing code and see how other developers used specific parts of the Obsidian API. Thanks to this project, it was possible to download all repositories and search through them extremely fast.

Nowadays, GitHub Code Search works much better, tools like Sourcegraph solve these problems, and finally -- Obsidian has become a well-documented product with a large community.

🔎 This allows to easily search and analyze other plugins. It's especially useful as Obsidian API isn't yet documented and GitHub search doesn't work as expected.
